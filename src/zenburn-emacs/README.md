# About #

Zenburn for Emacs is a direct port of the popular
[Zenburn](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/ Zenburn) theme for vim,
developed originally by Jani Nurminen. It's my personal belief(and
that of many of its users I presume) that it's one of the best low
contrast themes out there and that Zenburn is exceptionally easy on
the eyes.

The project was originally ported to Emacs by Daniel Brockman, but it
seems that he has lost interest in it recently. This is the reason why
I gathered here all improvements over the last official Zenburn
version and started this fork of the project. It's my hope that it
will be become a central place for zenburn development.  

# Installation #

Zenburn depends on the color-theme package, so you should have it
installed. After that just put this in your .emacs(or equivalent):

`(require 'zenburn)`

# Bugs & Improvements #
